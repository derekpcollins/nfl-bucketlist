# NFL Bucketlist

Documenting our attempt to visit every NFL stadium.

## Notes

- I pulled the list of NFL stadiums from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_stadiums).
- I pulled the NFL team logos from [this website](https://www.sportslogos.net/teams/list_by_year/72023/2023_NFL_Logos/).
- I'm using [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the icons.
- Using ESModules with a good [intro here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/super-simple-start-to-es-modules-in-the-browser).
- Using a [`for...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).
- Used the [CSS Shadow Palette Generator](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/) for the card shadows.

## Setup

To serve the site locally:

`npx serve src/`

You can optionally specifying a port by passing in a `-p` flag, such as:

`npx serve src/ -p 3030`

Or using Vercel
